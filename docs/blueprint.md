# **App Name**: Diseño Divino Landing

## Core Features:

- Hero Section with 3D Neon Floor: Create an engaging hero section featuring a 3D neon floor in a 3D perspective which should be interactive, using #40E0D0 for the neon and a light gray variant for the background.
- Modern Navbar: Implement a modern, sophisticated navbar with an Apple-inspired glass effect. The navbar should include links to Home, About, Events, Team, and Contact.
- About Section: Detail what 'Diseño Divino' does, including a 'What We Do?' subsection.
- Events Section: Showcase upcoming and past events with descriptions and dates.
- Team Section: Introduce the club's team members with photos and brief bios.
- Contact Section: Include a 'Get In Touch' form for users to send messages or inquiries.
- Dark Mode: Implement a fully functional dark mode with proper color switching in all components.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Turquoise (#40E0D0) to represent creativity and energy, per the user's request.
- Background color: Off-white/light grey (#F0F0F0) as a subtle, neutral base.
- Accent color: Dark gray (#444444) to provide contrast and grounding for text and interactive elements, as specified by the user.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines; its geometric style fits a modern design club. Body text: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif), well-suited for the app, is used to complement the title.
- Use minimalistic icons with a slight 'pop' effect, consistent with the 3D design, to represent different sections and functions.
- Incorporate 3D elements and subtle shadows throughout the site to give a sense of depth and interactivity.
- Implement subtle animations on button hover and transitions between sections to enhance the 'popping out' effect and overall user experience.
